# raymarcher
A raymarcher written both to learn more about Rust and signed distance functions.

Not very user-friendly, but you can see how to specify which scene to render [here](https://github.com/pema99/raymarcher/blob/master/src/main.rs#L26).

Supports a handfull of primitives as well as constructive-solid-geometry operators for combining them.

Here are some pics:
